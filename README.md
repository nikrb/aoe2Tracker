An AOE2:DE game analysis tool.

I was looking for an app to write to learn svelte, so don't expect any best practices :)

# why

Build orders are all well and good, but the pros rarely stick to them. So this tool is an attempt to analyze their build orders. I haven't really gone beyond castle age as I think build orders mostly relate to the point of reaching castle age.

# how

Click the record button at the start of a game and enter the appropriate villager levels on each resource. The research buttons can also be clicked to add them into the build. Hit the report button when you're done and this will produce an html build order.

There is a playback mode, but I'm not sure it's useful. 

# install

Just clone the repo, run npm install and npm run dev then connect from a browser.

# Acknowledgements

This app would not be possible without the data collected and kept up to date from the [seige engineers](https://siegeengineers.org/)
